Plans of the highest priority are listed first.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Delete intrusive bindings for mouse. (gtags.el)
<li>Detecting and ignoring recursive symbolic links. (gtags)
<li>Support tag stack per window. Currently tag stack is only one per emacs. (gtags.el)
<li>Pickup definitions of data type, enum name, enum value, struct member name,
	union name and struct name in C language.
	Finally, remove GSYMS. (gtags-parser, gtags)
<li>Rewrite cgi program with C language instead of Perl.
<li>Support glob pattern for path name search (global -P).
<li>New --nofollow option for gtags(1). This option make it not follow symbolic links.
<li>Rewrite gtags-parser(1) using flex(1) completely.
<li>Support new languages.
	Here is a list of candidates:
        <ul>
	<li>Lex
	<li>C#
	<li>Scheme
        </ul>
<li>Add support of built-in parser for gtags(1).<br>
	Since this parser is linked to gtags at function layer, we can make
	simpler and more efficient gtags without any external commands.
<li>Rewrite function header using Doxygen style.
<li>The --dynamic option generates not only index files but also hypertext
	of source code itself.
<li>Support gtags-query-replace (gtags.el).
<li>Visual interface using GUI.
<li>Ttags(1) command.<br>
        Ttags(1) is similar to htags(1) but makes TeX source for a book
        instead of hypertext.
<li>Allow spaces in path name of source files.
<li>Support multi-bytes code set.
<li>Make the links in the hypertext generated by htags(1) context sensitive.<br>
	For example, if you have a pointer p to a struct B with a field b,
	and write p->b in the code, the "b" is linked to the field in B.
	It supports struct, class and namespace(C++).
<li>Support tag type. (like Exuberant Ctags.)
</ul>
