Plans of the highest priority are listed first.
<p>
<ul>
<li>More detailed tutorial and manual.<br>
<li>Include external parsers.<br>
	I would like to include the parser which belongs to
        <a href=http://sources.redhat.com/sourcenav/>Source-Navigator</a>.
<li>Write plugged-in parser writer's guide.
<li>Pickup definitions of data type, macro with no argument, 
enum name, enum value, union name and struct name. Finally, remove GSYMS.
<li>Support of other languages.<br>
        <ul>
	<li>PHP
        <li>Scheme
        <li>Texinfo
        <li>LaTeX
	<li>Lex
        </ul>
<li>Visual interface using GUI.
<li>Ttags(1) command.<br>
        Ttags(1) is similar to htags(1) but makes TeX source for a book
        instead of hypertext.
</ul>
Any contributions are appreciated.
