This is the factory of GLOBAL's site.

How to maintain?

1. Modify *.in files.
	Don't modify *.html files directly because they are generated
	automatically from *.in by makehtml.pl.
	You should modify *.in files instead.
2. Generate *.html files by executing 'make'.
	When modification has been completed then please type 'make'.
	It generates *.html files. You should do this before commit
	your modifications to CVS repository, because repository needs
	*.html files.
3. Commit modifications to CVS repository.
	It will replace the contents of http://www.gnu.org/software/global/.

You need to bring following files from GLOBAL package by hand.

o global.texi as globaldoc.texi (used by tutorial).
o NEWS (used by What's new).
o ChangeLog (used by What's new).
