	See <a href='http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/info-global/2006-04/msg00000.html'>release note</a>.

	making time of tag files generated by gtags(1) were greatly reduced.
<dt>2006/4/6<dd>
	<a href='http://home.tiscali.de/mgidde/Emacs.html#xgtags'>Xgtags.el</a>
        provides an interface to the GLOBAL cross-refencing tools.
        While gtags.el, that comes with the GLOBAL distribution, is more a
        replacement for emacs' own find-tag/pop-tag-mark facility with some
        extra stuff, xgtags.el tries to permit the same functionality as
        gtags.el, but behaves more like xcscope.el, the emacs interface for
        cscope (http://cscope.sourceforge.net).
<dt>2005/9/30<dd>
	GLOBAL-4.8.7 was released. See <a href='http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/info-global/2005-09/threads.html'>release note</a>.

	improved by Hideki Iwamoto.

	tool using 'Htags Hyper-text Reference Kit' which is part of the package.
