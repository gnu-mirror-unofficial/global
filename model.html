<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
<i>BOKIN Model</i> is a business model to obtain proceeds by widely collecting
donations while developing and distributing free software.
This model is constructed not to take away consumer's freedom of software.
<p>
The business which comply with the following criteria can be called
<i>a business based on BOKIN Model</i>.
<p>
<h2>Criteria</h2>
<p>
<ol>

corporation registered in the home country.
(Herein after called <i>the corporation</i>)
<p>

<p>
<li>LICENSE<br>
The corporation distributes the BOKINware under GNU GPL (GNU General Public

external packages which the BOKINware uses, small supporting files,
short manuals and rough documentation can use
simple all-permissive license, compatible with GNU GPL.
<p>

To include program which is assigned from another developer, the corporation
receives a disclaimer paper or assignment paper signed by the author.
<li>
To include program which is not assigned, the corporation confirms its license
is GNU GPL or compatible with GNU GPL, lists the files and authors in a file
named <b>AUTHORS</b>, and lists the license in a file named <b>LICENSE</b>.
The BOKINware should contain these two files.
</ul>
<p>

BOKINware. This list is also for user discussion.
<li>Help mailing list<br>
This list is the place for authors, users and installers of the
BOKINware to ask for help.

<p>

<h2>BOKIN Model Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<p>
<ol>
<li>What does <i>BOKIN</i> mean?<br>
<i>BOKIN</i> means collecting donations in Japanese.
(<i>BO</i>=collect, <i>KIN</i>=money)
<p>
<li>What is the purpose to require the person who start a BOKIN model business being a registered corporation?<br>
The purpose is to prevent people from donating to the person who does not
exist actually.
<p>
<li>Is annoying copyright management necessary?<br>
Yes, it is.
Copyright management is absolutely necessary for consumers
to keep on using the BOKINware at ease.
<p>
It is dangerous to use the software whose copyright is not neatly managed.
If you use such software, you might suddenly be prohibited to use it,
or be claimed a license fee of high priced. These are not imaginary fears
but troubles of reality.
<p>
<li>Why is program license limited to GNU GPL?<br>
Because GNU GPL defends consumers in two points.
<ul>
<li>Copyleft License<br>
Since GNU GPL is copyleft license, it makes a program free,
and requiring all modified and extended versions of the program
to be free as well. As a result, consumer can keep on using the
BOKINware at ease in the future.
<li>Widely Known<br>
Since GNU GPL is widely known, and is explained frequently,
it does not become the load to consumer. It is troublesome
for consumer to understand new licenses.
</ul>
<p>
<li>What is the purpose of the donor list?<br>
There are two purposes.
<ul>
<li>To defend freedom of donation.<br>
The consumer can decide whether to donate after understanding
the situation of the donation.
If nothing being informed, freedom does not exist there.
In BOKIN model, consumers are not isolated existence.
<li>To praise donation.<br>
To praise donation brings new donors.
Since BOKIN model owes all to people's free wills, we cannot praise
the donation too much.
</ul>
<p>
<li>Is donation spent on the BOKINware?<br>
It depends on the management of the corporation.
Since donations become the proceeds of the corporation, the corporation
itself decides the usage under its freedom.
<p>
<li>Is the donor list kept true?<br>
It is very difficult to mix lies in the public information, because
it is checked by various methods.
<p>
<ul>
<li>
Donors can confirm whether they are listed.
<li>
People can ask whether to have donated to the donors in the list.
<li>
The tax office can examine the contradiction between the content
of the list and the content of the declaration of the corporation's
taxation business.
</ul>
<p>
<li>Why is the corporation prohibited from doing an individual supply of profit for the donors?<br>
When individual supply of profit becomes ordinary, donation fall into
the payment for the profit. We cannot call it donation.
BOKIN Model business should be supported only by people's free will.
