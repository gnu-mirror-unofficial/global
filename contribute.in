Any contributions are appreciated.
Especially, we hope you to write new parsers which work well with GLOBAL
to support various languages.
Besides, there are <a href=plans.html>many jobs</a>
we should do about GLOBAL.
<p>
But I cannot merge your copyrighted code into core GLOBAL.
I may ask you to write a disclaimer paper like this:
<pre>
======================================================================

    I, NAME OF PERSON, hereby disclaim all copyright interest in my
    changes and enhancements to GLOBAL (herein called
    the "Program").

    I affirm that I have no other intellectual property interest that
    would undermine this release, or the use of the Program, and will
    do nothing to undermine it in the future.  I represent that the
    changes and enhancements are my own and not a copy of someone
    else's work.

    &lt;signature and date&gt;

This is a general method of GNU software.

If you don't have any time and any abilities to write code, please think about
