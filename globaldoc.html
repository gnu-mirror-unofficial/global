<H1><A NAME="SEC1">1. Overview of this tool</A></H1>



<H2><A NAME="SEC2">1.1 What is GNU GLOBAL?</A></H2>

<P>
GNU GLOBAL is a source code tag system that works the same way
across diverse environments such as Emacs editor, Vi editor,
Less viewer, Bash shell, various web browsers, etc.
You can locate specified objects such as functions, macros, structs, classes
in your source files and move there easily.
It is useful for hacking large projects which contain many sub-directories,
many <CODE>#ifdef</CODE> and many <CODE>main()</CODE> functions.
It is similar to ctags or etags, but is different from them at the point of
independence of any editor.




<H2><A NAME="SEC3">1.2 Concept of project</A></H2>

<P>
GNU GLOBAL can treat a source tree containing sub-directories as a project.
Anywhere in the project, you can utilize high performance tag database.
You need not specify where the database is.
Instead, global(1) locates it by itself.
Because of this feature, you can move freely in a project,
and in and out of many projects.




<H2><A NAME="SEC4">1.3 Features</A></H2>

<P>
GNU GLOBAL has following features:



<UL>
<LI>support C, C++, Yacc, Java, PHP4 and assembly.

<LI>work the same way across diverse environments like follows:


<UL>
<LI>Shell command line

<LI>Bash shell

<LI>Vi editor (Nvi, Elvis, vim)

<LI>Less viewer

<LI>Emacs editor (Emacs, Mule, Xemacs)

<LI>Web browser

<LI>Doxygen documentation system

</UL>

<LI>find the locations of specified object quickly.

<LI>locate not only object definitions but also object references.

<LI>allows duplicate objects.

<LI>locate path names which include specified pattern.

<LI>hierarchical search is available.

<LI>search not only in a source project but also in library projects.

<LI>generate completion list for completing input method.

<LI>support various output format.

<LI>allows customizing of the set of candidate files to be tagged.

<LI>understand POSIX 1003.2 regular expression.

<LI>support idutils as an external search engine.

<LI>tag files are independent of machine architecture.

<LI>support incremental updating of tag files.

<LI>plug-in parser is available to treat new language.

<LI>support customizing with <TT>`gtags.conf'</TT>.

<LI>generate a hypertext of source code.

</UL>



<H1><A NAME="SEC5">2. Command line GLOBAL</A></H1>

<P>
You can use the tag facilities from shell command line.
It is a big merit of GLOBAL compared with any other tag systems.




<H2><A NAME="SEC6">2.1 Preparation</A></H2>

<P>
First of all, you must execute gtags(1)(see section <A HREF="globaldoc.html#SEC61">5.2 gtags - create tag files for global.</A>) at the root of source tree.
For example, if you want to browse the source code of Vi editor in FreeBSD,
please move to the source directory and invoke gtags(1).



<PRE>

    $ cd /usr/src/usr.bin/vi
    $ gtags

</PRE>

<P>
Gtags traverses sub-directories, picks up source files and makes four tag files
at the current directory.
After this, the whole files under this directory is treated as a project.



<PRE>

    $ ls G*
    GPATH   GRTAGS  GSYMS   GTAGS

</PRE>


<UL>
<LI><TT>`GTAGS'</TT>

        definition database
<LI><TT>`GRTAGS'</TT>

        reference database
<LI><TT>`GSYMS'</TT>

        symbol database
<LI><TT>`GPATH'</TT>

        path name database
</UL>

<P>
The <TT>`GSYMS'</TT> is for the symbols which are not defined in <TT>`GTAGS'</TT>.


<P>
You should prepare for considerable disk space for the tag files.
For example, FreeBSD 7.0 kernel source code requires the following disk space.



<PRE>
    source code(/usr/src/sys)       123MB

    GPATH                             1MB
    GTAGS                            26MB
    GRTAGS                           22MB
    GSYMS                            23MB
    -------------------------------------
    total of tag files               72MB
</PRE>



<H2><A NAME="SEC7">2.2 Basic usage</A></H2>

<P>
Consider the following source tree:



<PRE>

/home/user/
 |
 |-ROOT/      &#60;- the root of source tree (GTAGS,GRTAGS,...)
    |
    |- README       .....   +---------------+
    |                       |The function of|

    |  |                    |       func2();|
    |  |                    |}              |

                            |#else          |
                            |func2(){ i--; }|
                            |#endif         |

                            |}              |
                            +---------------+

</PRE>


<UL>
<LI>Once you make tag files at the root directory of the source tree,

you can execute global(1) from anywhere in the tree.
By default, you get the relative path of the located files.
You need not specify where the tag file is. Instead, global(1) locates it by itself.


<PRE>

    $ cd /home/user/ROOT
    $ global func1
    DIR1/fileB.c            # func1() is defined in fileB.c
    $ cd DIR1
    $ global func1
    fileB.c                 # relative path from DIR1
    $ cd ../DIR2
    $ global func1
    ../DIR1/fileB.c         # relative path from DIR2

</PRE>

Global command is possible to use only when you are in a project.
If you are out of any project, it brings an error message like follows:


<PRE>

    $ cd /home/user
    $ global func1
    global: GTAGS not found.

</PRE>

<LI>The <SAMP>`-r'</SAMP> option locates object references.

<A NAME="IDX1"></A>


<PRE>

    $ global -r func2
    ../DIR1/fileA.c         # func2() is referred from fileA.c

</PRE>

<LI>You can use POSIX regular expressions.


<PRE>

    $ cd /home/user/ROOT
    $ global 'func[1-3]'
    DIR1/fileB.c            # func1, func2 and func3 are matched
    DIR2/fileC.c

</PRE>

<LI>The <SAMP>`-x'</SAMP> option shows the details.

It is similar to the <SAMP>`-x'</SAMP> option in ctags(1).
<A NAME="IDX2"></A>


<PRE>

    $ global func2
    DIR2/fileC.c
    $ global -x func2
    func2              2 DIR2/fileC.c       func2(){ i++; }
    func2              4 DIR2/fileC.c       func2(){ i--; }

</PRE>

<LI>The <SAMP>`-a'</SAMP> option produces the absolute path name.

<A NAME="IDX3"></A>


<PRE>

    $ global -a func1
    /home/user/ROOT/DIR1/fileB.c

</PRE>

<LI>The <SAMP>`-s'</SAMP> command locates symbols which are not defined in <TT>`GTAGS'</TT>.

<A NAME="IDX4"></A>


<PRE>

    $ global -xs X
    X                  1 DIR2/fileC.c #ifdef X

</PRE>

<LI>The <SAMP>`-g'</SAMP> command locates the lines which have specified pattern.

<A NAME="IDX5"></A>


<PRE>

    $ global -xg '#ifdef'
    #ifdef             1 DIR2/fileC.c #ifdef X

</PRE>

It is similar to egrep(1) but is far more convenient for source code reading,
because it allows you to search through a project, and only in the source files.

Additionally, you can use various options:
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE><KBD>-O</KBD></CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX6"></A>
search only in the text files.
<DT><CODE><KBD>-o</KBD></CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX7"></A>
search in both the source files and text files.
<DT><CODE><KBD>-l</KBD></CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX8"></A>
search only under the current directory.
</DL>

The <KBD>-e</KBD>, <KBD>-G</KBD> and <KBD>-i</KBD> options are available too.
The usage is the same as egrep(1).

You can even change the output format of global(1) to the grep style
using the <SAMP>`--result=grep'</SAMP> option.
<A NAME="IDX9"></A>
Of course, these options can be used even by other commands.

<LI>The <SAMP>`-P'</SAMP> command locates path names which include specified pattern.

<A NAME="IDX10"></A>


<PRE>

    $ global -P fileB
    DIR1/fileB.c
    $ global -P '1/'
    DIR1/fileA.c
    DIR1/fileB.c
    $ global -P '\.c$'
    DIR1/fileA.c
    DIR1/fileB.c
    DIR2/fileC.c

</PRE>

<LI>The <SAMP>`-f'</SAMP> command print a list of objects in specified file.

<A NAME="IDX11"></A>


<PRE>

    $ global -f DIR2/fileC.c
    func2              2 DIR2/fileC.c   func2(){ i++; }
    func2              4 DIR2/fileC.c   func2(){ i--; }
    func3              6 DIR2/fileC.c   func3(){

</PRE>

<LI>The <SAMP>`-l'</SAMP> option limits the range of the retrieval under the current directory.

<A NAME="IDX12"></A>

<PRE>

    $ cd DIR1
    $ global -xl func[1-3]
    func1        1 fileB.c      func1(){...}

</PRE>

</UL>



<H2><A NAME="SEC8">2.3 Applied usage</A></H2>


<UL>
<LI>You can customize a set of candidate files to be tagged.

<A NAME="IDX13"></A>


<PRE>

    $ find . -type f -print &#62;/tmp/list     # make a file set
    $ vi /tmp/list                         # customize the file set
    $ gtags -f /tmp/list

</PRE>

<LI>If your source files are on a read-only device, such as CDROM,

then you cannot make tag files at the root of the source tree.
In such case, you can make tag files in another place using
the <CODE>GTAGSROOT</CODE> environment variable.


<PRE>

    $ mkdir /var/dbpath
    $ cd /cdrom/src                 # the root of source tree
    $ gtags /var/dbpath             # make tag files in /var/dbpath
    $ export GTAGSROOT=`pwd`
    $ export GTAGSDBPATH=/var/dbpath
    $ global func

</PRE>

There is another method for it. Since global(1) locates tag files also in
<TT>`/usr/obj'</TT> + &#60;current directory&#62;, you can setup like follows:


<PRE>

    $ cd /cdrom/src                 # the root of source tree
    $ mkdir -p /usr/obj/cdrom/src
    $ gtags /usr/obj/cdrom/src      # make tag files in /usr/obj/cdrom/src
    $ global func

</PRE>

The value <TT>`/usr/obj'</TT> can be changed by environment variable
<CODE>MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX</CODE>.
The <SAMP>`-O, --objdir'</SAMP> option do it automatically instead of you.
<A NAME="IDX14"></A>

<LI>If you want to locate objects that are not defined in the source tree,

then you can specify library directories with the <CODE>GTAGSLIBPATH</CODE>
environment variable.

You should execute gtags at each directory of the path.
If <TT>`GTAGS'</TT> is not found there, global ignores it.


<PRE>

    $ pwd
    /develop/src/mh                         # this is a source project
    $ gtags
    $ ls G*TAGS
    GRTAGS  GTAGS
    $ global mhl
    uip/mhlsbr.c                            # mhl() is found
    $ global strlen                         # strlen() is not found
    $ (cd /usr/src/lib; gtags)              # library source
    $ (cd /usr/src/sys; gtags)              # kernel source
    $ export GTAGSLIBPATH=/usr/src/lib:/usr/src/sys
    $ global strlen
    ../../../usr/src/lib/libc/string/strlen.c  # found in library
    $ global access
    ../../../usr/src/sys/kern/vfs_syscalls.c   # found in kernel

</PRE>

Or, you can take a more straightforward way to do the same thing.
In the following example, we treat as if the system library and the kernel
are part of our project.


<PRE>

    $ ln -s /usr/src/lib .
    $ ln -s /usr/src/sys .
    $ gtags
    $ global strlen
    lib/libc/string/strlen.c
    $ global access
    sys/kern/vfs_syscalls.c

</PRE>

<LI>If you forget object names, you can use the <SAMP>`-c'</SAMP> (complete) command.

<A NAME="IDX15"></A>


<PRE>

    $ global -c kmem                # maybe k..k.. kmem..
    kmem_alloc
    kmem_alloc_pageable
    kmem_alloc_wait
    kmem_free
    kmem_free_wakeup
    kmem_init
    kmem_malloc
    kmem_suballoc                   # This is what I need!
    $ global kmem_suballoc
    ../vm/vm_kern.c

</PRE>

<LI>You can use the <SAMP>`-c'</SAMP> command with the complete command in the shell.

In Bash:

<PRE>

    $ funcs()
    &#62; {
    &#62;         local cur
    &#62;         cur=${COMP_WORDS[COMP_CWORD]}
    &#62;         COMPREPLY=(`global -c $cur`)
    &#62; }
    $ complete -F funcs global
    $ global kmem_<KBD>TAB</KBD><KBD>TAB</KBD>
    kmem_alloc           kmem_alloc_wait      kmem_init
    kmem_alloc_nofault   kmem_free            kmem_malloc
    kmem_alloc_pageable  kmem_free_wakeup     kmem_suballoc
    $ global kmem_s<KBD>TAB</KBD>
    $ global kmem_suballoc
    ../vm/vm_kern.c

</PRE>

In Tcsh:

<PRE>

    % set funcs=(`global -c`)
    % complete global 'n/*/$funcs/'
    % global kmem_<KBD>TAB</KBD>
    kmem_alloc          kmem_free_wakeup
    kmem_alloc_pageable kmem_init
    kmem_alloc_wait     kmem_malloc
    kmem_free           kmem_suballoc
    % global kmem_s<KBD>TAB</KBD>
    % global kmem_suballoc
    ../vm/vm_kern.c

</PRE>

If you like input completion, you had better try globash(see section <A HREF="globaldoc.html#SEC10">3.1 Global facility for Bash</A>).
It support you in a suitable way without any preparation.

<LI>You can edit all files which have specified objects by typing

one command, for example:


<PRE>

    $ vi `global func1`     # edit fileB.c

</PRE>

<LI>If you want to browse many files in order, do the following:


<PRE>

    $ global -xr fork | awk '{printf "view +%s %s\n",$2,$3}'
    view +650 ../dev/aic7xxx/aic7xxx_asm.c
    view +250 ibcs2/ibcs2_misc.c
    view +401 linux/linux_misc.c
    view +310 ../kern/init_main.c
    view +318 ../kern/init_main.c
    view +336 ../kern/init_main.c
    view +351 ../kern/init_main.c
    $ !! | sh            # from now on, go to next tag with 'ZZ'.

</PRE>

<H3><A NAME="SEC12">3.1.2 Preparation</A></H3>

<P>
First, do the preparation of global. See section <A HREF="globaldoc.html#SEC6">2.1 Preparation</A>.
And you can invoke Bash(1) with <SAMP>`--rcfile'</SAMP> option.

<PRE>

    $ bash --rcfile /usr/local/share/gtags/globash.rc

</PRE>

<P>
You will see a prompt like this:

<PRE>

    [/usr/src/sys]/kern _

</PRE>

<P>
This prompt means that the current directory is '/usr/src/sys/kern' and
the root directory of the project is '/usr/src/sys'.
Tag and marker are valid only in a project.


<P>
When you try to go out of the project, globash warns like:

<PRE>

    [/usr/src/sys] cd ..
    You are going to get out of the current project.
    Tag stack and marker will be removed. Sure? ([y]/n)_

</PRE>

<P>
If you answer <KBD>y</KBD> and <KBD>RET</KBD>
or just <KBD>RET</KBD> in the above prompt then the tag stack and marker
(described later) will be removed.


<P>
If you need help then please type <KBD>ghelp</KBD>.

<P>
First, do the preparation of global. See section <A HREF="globaldoc.html#SEC6">2.1 Preparation</A>.


<P>
Second, to use global from Emacs, you need to load the <TT>`gtags.el'</TT>
and execute gtags-mode function in it.


<P>
Write the call to autoload function to your <TT>`$HOME/.emacs'</TT>,
start Emacs and execute gtags-mode function.
If you put <TT>`gtags.el'</TT> in a directory other than the standard
macro directory, you need to add it to <CODE>load-path</CODE>.



<PRE>

    $HOME/.emacs
    +------------------------------------------------------
    |(setq load-path (cons "/home/owner/global" load-path))
    |(autoload 'gtags-mode "gtags" "" t)

    |M-x gtags-mode[RET]
    +------------------------------------------------------

</PRE>

<P>
If you want to get into gtags-mode whenever you get into c-mode
then you can append the following code to your <TT>`$HOME/.emacs'</TT>.



<PRE>

      (setq c-mode-hook
          '(lambda ()
              (gtags-mode 1)
      ))

</PRE>



<H3><A NAME="SEC33">3.6.3 Usage</A></H3>


<UL>
<LI>To go to func1, invoke <CODE>gtags-find-tag</CODE>

and you can see a prompt in the mini-buffer. Then input the tag name.

<PRE>

    Find tag: func1			&#60;- 'Find tag: ' is a prompt

</PRE>

<LI>To go to the referenced point of func1, invoke <CODE>gtags-find-rtag</CODE>.


<PRE>

    Find tag (reference): func1

</PRE>

<LI>Tag name completion is available.

     You need to execute <CODE>gtags-make-complete-list</CODE> command before it.


<PRE>

    Find tag: fu<KBD>TAB</KBD>
    
    Find tag: func1                     &#60;- 'nc1' is appended by emacs

</PRE>

Please select a tag line by any Emacs command and press <KBD>RET</KBD>,
and you can go to the tag's point. When you want to go to the next or
the previous tag, please return to the above mode with <CODE>gtags-pop-stack</CODE>
and reselect.

You can customize the path style in this mode by setting <CODE>gtags-path-style</CODE>
variable.

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE><CODE>root</CODE></CODE>
<DD>

</DL>

There are two method to set this variable:

<UL>
<LI>You can change it dynamically using the <CODE>customize</CODE> command of Emacs.

You will find the entry in the Programming/Tools/Gtags group.

<LI>You can change it when Emacs is loaded using <TT>`.emacs'</TT> file like this:


<PRE>

    (setq gtags-mode-hook
      '(lambda ()
        (setq gtags-path-style 'relative)))

</PRE>

</UL>

<LI><CODE>gtags-find-tag-from-here</CODE> command is available.

If current token is a definition, it is equivalent to
<KBD>Find tag (reference): <VAR>current token</VAR>RET</KBD>,
otherwise it is equivalent to <KBD>Find tag: <VAR>current token</VAR>RET</KBD>.

<LI>To locate symbols which are not defined in <TT>`GTAGS'</TT>, try <CODE>gtags-find-symbol</CODE>.


<PRE>

    Find symbol: lbolt		&#60;- 'Find symbol:' is a prompt

</PRE>

<LI>To locate strings, try <CODE>gtags-find-with-grep</CODE>.


<PRE>

    Find pattern: Copyright

<LI>You can use POSIX regular expressions.


<PRE>

    Find tag: ^put_                 &#60;- locate tags start with 'put_'

</PRE>

<LI>Mouse command is available.

If you use X version Emacs, try the following:

Move the mouse cursor to an object name and click the middle button,
and you can go to the point of the definitions, or to its references,
depending on the context. In 'GTAGS SELECT MODE', move the mouse cursor
to a line and click the center button.

To return to the previous position, click the right button.
</UL>



<H2><A NAME="SEC34">3.7 Gtags-cscope (fake cscope)</A></H2>

<P>
You can use gtags-cscope(1) instead of cscope(1).
For example, you can deceive Vim editor using the following commands:



<PRE>

:set csprg=gtags-cscope
:cs add GTAGS

</PRE>

<P>
After this, you can use built-in 'cs find' commands in the Vim editor.
Though the deceit is not perfect ('cs find d' is not implemented),
this method might be more convenient than <TT>`gtags.vim'</TT> in the point that
you can use the tag stack facility of Vim.




<H2><A NAME="SEC35">3.8 Hypertext generator</A></H2>

<P>
You can use GLOBAL's facilities from web browsers.




<H3><A NAME="SEC36">3.8.1 Features</A></H3>


<UL>
<LI>Htags makes a hypertext from C, C++, Yacc and Java source files.

<LI>Once the hypertext is generated, you need nothing other than a web browser.

<LI>You can move the hypertext to anywhere. It is independent of the source code.

<LI>You can use all of your browser's functions, such as search,

     history, bookmark, save, frames, windows, etc.
</UL>



<H3><A NAME="SEC37">3.8.2 Preparation</A></H3>

<P>
At first, you must ensure that you have a lot of disk space for hypertext.
For example, FreeBSD 7.0 kernel source code (123MB) requires disk space
from 600 to 1200MB.



<PRE>

    source code(/usr/src/sys)            123MB
    GPATH,GTAGS,GRTAGS,GSYMS              72MB

    hypertext (with no option)           645MB
    hypertext (with -s option)          1168MB
    hypertext (with -D option)           383MB
    hypertext (with -s and -D option)    616MB
   
</PRE>

<P>
Please invoke gtags(1)(see section <A HREF="globaldoc.html#SEC61">5.2 gtags - create tag files for global.</A>) and htags(1)(see section <A HREF="globaldoc.html#SEC75">5.3 htags - generate a hypertext from a set of source files.</A>)
in order like this:



<PRE>

    (at the root directory of your source project)
    $ gtags                 # make tag files(GTAGS,GRTAGS,GSYMS)
    $ htags                 # make hypertext(HTML/)

</PRE>

<P>
Then you will find a directory named <TT>`HTML'</TT> in the current directory.


<P>
Htags has rich options. If you are new on htags then you are recommended to use
the <SAMP>`--suggest'</SAMP> option. This option makes some popular options effective,
and invokes gtags(1) if there is no tag files.



<PRE>

    $ htags --suggest

</PRE>

<P>
If HTTP server is available then the -D and -f option are also useful.




<H3><A NAME="SEC38">3.8.3 Usage</A></H3>

<P>
Please start a web browser like this:



<PRE>

    $ lynx HTML/index.html

</PRE>

<P>
You will understand the usage by looking at the examples.


<P>
You can move the HTML directory to anywhere. It is independent of the
source code as long as CGI facility is not used.


<P>
Using mozilla, you can also utilize the hypertext from your command line like this:



<PRE>

    $ mozilla				# load mozilla
    $ global -x main
    main        10 main.c main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    $ gozilla +10 main.c		# usage is similar to vi editor.
    (show main.c at 10 on mozilla's screen.)
    
</PRE>

<P>
But in this case, you must not move the HTML directory from the source directory.




<H2><A NAME="SEC39">3.9 Doxygen using GLOBAL</A></H2>

<P>
You can use GLOBAL as the source browser of Doxygen.


<P>
Doxygen Release 1.4.3 or later has config option USE_HTAGS.
When enabled in combination with SOURCE_BROWSER=YES, htags(1) is
used as the source browser instead of Doxygen's own. 


<P>
Here is an example.



<PRE>

(in source directory)
$ doxygen -g
$ vi Doxyfile
+---------------------------------
|...
|INPUT                  = .
|RECURSIVE              = YES

$ doxygen
$ lynx html/index.html

</PRE>



<H1><A NAME="SEC40">4. Other topics</A></H1>



<H2><A NAME="SEC41">4.1 How to config GLOBAL</A></H2>

<P>
You can customize GLOBAL using configuration file.



<PRE>

    # cp gtags.conf /etc/gtags.conf         # system wide config file.
    # vi /etc/gtags.conf

    $ cp gtags.conf $HOME/.globalrc         # personal config file.
    $ vi $HOME/.globalrc

</PRE>

<P>
If <TT>`$HOME/.globalrc'</TT> exists then GLOBAL use it, else if <TT>`/etc/gtags.conf'</TT>
exists then GLOBAL use it. Otherwise default value is used.
The format of <TT>`gtags.conf'</TT> is resemble to termcap(5). By default, 'default'
target is used.
About the capabilities, please see each command manual. See section <A HREF="globaldoc.html#SEC46">5. Command References</A>.




<H2><A NAME="SEC42">4.2 Plug-in parser</A></H2>

<P>
You can write new parser for gtags(1).


<P>
Command layer plug-in parser is obsolete.
Please see <TT>`plugin-example/'</TT> to know function layer plug-in parser.




<H3><A NAME="SEC43">4.2.1 How to plug in a parser</A></H3>

<P>
Copy <TT>`gtags.conf'</TT> to <TT>`/etc/gtags.conf'</TT> or <TT>`$HOME/.globalrc'</TT>.


<P>
If you would like to use exuberant ctags included by Vim editor,



<PRE>

    $ cd /<VAR>vim source directory</VAR>/src/ctags
    $ cp Makefile.unix Makefile
    $ make
    # cp ctags /usr/local/bin/ctags-exuberant
    $ export GTAGSLABEL=ctags-exuberant     # see gtags.conf
    $ gtags
    $ ls G*
    GPATH   GTAGS

</PRE>

<P>
<TT>`GRTAGS'</TT> and <TT>`GSYMS'</TT> don't exist, simply because
these parsers don't support the <SAMP>`-r'</SAMP> option and <SAMP>`-s'</SAMP> option like gtags-parser(1) does.
If you prepare the parser which support both option, you can use all functions of global(1).
<A NAME="IDX30"></A>
<A NAME="IDX31"></A>




<H3><A NAME="SEC44">4.2.2 Requirement of plug-in parser</A></H3>

<P>
Plug-in parser must print tag information to standard output
in the same style as <CODE>ctags -x</CODE>, ie.:



<PRE>

    [1]    [2] [3]          [4]
    ------------------------------------------------------------------
    main    20 ./main.c     main(argc, argv)        /* xxx */
    
    [1] tag name
    [2] line number the tag appeared
    [3] path name. It must be equal to argument path name.
    [4] line image

</PRE>

<P>
Plug-in parser must process the files in the order they are given
in the argument. In each file, any order is acceptable.



<UL>
<LI>Good example

The following <CODE>good-prog</CODE> does correct operation as a plug-in parser.


<PRE>
        $ good-prog a.c b.c        &#60;= order: a.c -&#62; b.c

<H3><A NAME="SEC50">DESCRIPTION</A></H3>
<P>
Global finds locations of the specified object
in C, C++, Yacc, Java, PHP and Assembly source files,
and print the path name, line number and line image of the locations.
Global can locate not only object definitions but also object
references and other symbols.


<P>
Global can treat a source tree, that is, a directory that
has sub-directories and source files as a project.
In advance of using this command, you must execute gtags(1)
at the root directory of a project to make tag files.
Then you can execute this command anywhere in the project.
You need not specify where the tag file is.
Instead, global locates it by itself.


<P>
You can specify a regular expression for the pattern.
Global understands two different versions of regular expression
syntax: basic and extended. The default is extended.

<H3><A NAME="SEC78">DESCRIPTION</A></H3>
<P>
Htags generates a hypertext from a set of source files of
C, C++, Yacc, Java, PHP and Assembly.


<P>
In advance of using this command, you should execute gtags(1)
in the root directory of a source project.
Then you can execute htags in the same place.
Htags makes a directory named <TT>`HTML'</TT>, and put a hypertext in it.
You can start browsing at <TT>`HTML/index.html'</TT>.


<P>
Since htags generates a static hypertext as long as the <SAMP>`-D'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`-f'</SAMP>
option is not specified, you can move it anywhere and browse it by any browser without
any HTTP server.


<P>
This command has so many options.
If you are new on htags, it is recommended to use the <SAMP>`--suggest'</SAMP> option.
With that option, htags chooses popular options on behalf of you.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
</PRE>


<OL>
<LI>

PREAMBLE

The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document <EM>free</EM> in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.

This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.

We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.

<LI>

APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The "Document", below,
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
under copyright law.

A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in
part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.

The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input
format, @acronym{SGML} or @acronym{XML} using a publicly available
@acronym{DTD}, and standard-conforming simple @acronym{HTML},
PostScript or @acronym{PDF} designed for human modification.  Examples
of transparent image formats include @acronym{PNG}, @acronym{XCF} and
@acronym{JPG}.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be
read and edited only by proprietary word processors, @acronym{SGML} or
@acronym{XML} for which the @acronym{DTD} and/or processing tools are
not generally available, and the machine-generated @acronym{HTML},
PostScript or @acronym{PDF} produced by some word processors for
output purposes only.

The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements",
"Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)  To "Preserve the Title"
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.

The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.

<LI>

VERBATIM COPYING

You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.

<LI>

COPYING IN QUANTITY

If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.

It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

<LI>

MODIFICATIONS

You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:


<OL>
<LI>

Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
(which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
if the original publisher of that version gives permission.

<LI>

List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
unless they release you from this requirement.

<LI>

State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
Modified Version, as the publisher.

<LI>

Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

<LI>

Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
adjacent to the other copyright notices.

<LI>

Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.

<LI>

Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.

Include an unaltered copy of this License.

<LI>

Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and add
to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
there is no section Entitled "History" in the Document, create one
stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
Version as stated in the previous sentence.

<LI>

Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.
You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.

<LI>

For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications", Preserve
the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the
substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or
dedications given therein.

<LI>

Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,

</OL>

If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

<LI>

COMBINING DOCUMENTS

You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History"
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
"History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements",
and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You must delete all
sections Entitled "Endorsements."

<LI>

COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.

<LI>

AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.

If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.

<LI>

TRANSLATION

Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
"Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.

<LI>

TERMINATION

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to
copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,
parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

<LI>

<H3><A NAME="SEC134">BOKIN Model Frequently Asked Questions</A></H3>


<OL>
<LI>What does <EM>BOKIN</EM> mean?<BR>

<EM>BOKIN</EM> means collecting donations in Japanese.
(<EM>BO</EM>=collect, <EM>KIN</EM>=money)

<LI>What is the purpose to require the person who start a BOKIN model business being a registered corporation?<BR>

The purpose is to prevent people from donating to the person who does not
exist actually.

<LI>Is annoying copyright management necessary?<BR>

Yes, it is.
Copyright management is absolutely necessary for consumers
to keep on using the BOKINware at ease.

It is dangerous to use the software whose copyright is not neatly managed.
If you use such software, you might suddenly be prohibited to use it,
or be claimed a license fee of high priced. These are not imaginary fears
but troubles of reality.

<LI>Why is program license limited to GNU GPL?<BR>

Because GNU GPL defends consumers in two points.

<UL>
<LI>Copyleft License<BR>

Since GNU GPL is copyleft license, it makes a program free,
and requiring all modified and extended versions of the program
to be free as well. As a result, consumer can keep on using the
BOKINware at ease in the future.
<LI>Widely Known<BR>

Since GNU GPL is widely known, and is explained frequently,
it does not become the load to consumer. It is troublesome
for consumer to understand new licenses.
</UL>

<LI>What is the purpose of the donor list?<BR>

There are two purposes.

<UL>
<LI>To defend freedom of donation.<BR>

The consumer can decide whether to donate after understanding
the situation of the donation.
If nothing being informed, freedom does not exist there.
In BOKIN model, consumers are not isolated existence.
<LI>To praise donation.<BR>

To praise donation brings new donors.
Since BOKIN model owes all to people's free wills, we cannot praise
the donation too much.
</UL>

<LI>Is donation spent on the BOKINware?<BR>

It depends on the management of the corporation.
Since donations become the proceeds of the corporation, the corporation
itself decides the usage under its freedom.

<LI>Is the donor list kept true?<BR>

It is very difficult to mix lies in the public information, because
it is checked by various methods.


<UL>
<LI>

Donors can confirm whether they are listed.
<LI>

People can ask whether to have donated to the donors in the list.
<LI>

The tax office can examine the contradiction between the content
of the list and the content of the declaration of the corporation's
taxation business.
</UL>

<LI>Why is the corporation prohibited from doing an individual supply of profit for the donors?<BR>

When individual supply of profit becomes ordinary, donation fall into
the payment for the profit. We cannot call it donation.
BOKIN Model business should be supported only by people's free will.
