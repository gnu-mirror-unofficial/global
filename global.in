GNU GLOBAL is a source code tagging system that works the same way
across diverse environments (emacs, vi, less, bash, web browser, etc).
You can locate specified objects in source files and move there easily.
It is useful for hacking a large project containing many subdirectories,
many <CODE>#ifdef</CODE> and many <CODE>main()</CODE> functions.
It is similar to ctags or etags but is different from them at the point of
independence of any editor.
It runs on a UNIX(POSIX) compatible operating system like GNU and BSD.

<p>
GNU GLOBAL is part of the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU project</a>,
and is <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free software</a>.

GNU GLOBAL is also commercial (for-profit) software based on
<a href='model.html'>BOKIN model</a>.

GNU GLOBAL has following features:

<ul>
<li> support C, C++, Yacc, Java and PHP4.
<li> work the same way across diverse environments.
        Currently, support followings:
        <ul>
        <li> Generic shell command line
        <li> Bash shell
        <li> Vi clone editor (nvi, elvis, vim)
        <li> Emacs editor (emacs, mule, xemacs)
	<li> Glimmer editor
	<li> Less viewer
        <li> Web browser
		(See <a href=http://www.tamacom.com/tour/kernel/linux/>UNIX kernel source tour!</a>.)
	<li> Doxygen documentation system
        </ul>
<li> find the locations of a specified object quickly.
<li> locate not only object definitions but also object references.
<li> allows duplicate objects.
<li> locate also path which includes specified pattern.
<li> treat a source tree containing subdirectories as a logical scope.
You can get the relative path of objects from anywhere within that scope.
<li> search not only in a source tree but also in library paths.
<li> understand POSIX 1003.2 regular expressions.
<li> support external search engine (grep and idutils).
<li> generate hypertext of source code (XHTML ready).
<li> tag files are independent of machine architecture.
<li> plugged-in parser is available to treat new language.
<li> compact format is available to save disk space.
<li> support incremental updating of tag files.
<li> support customizing with gtags.conf.
<li> generate completion list for completing input method.
</ul>

If you have a plan to make a yet another editor with tag facility
then you can use GLOBAL as the tag system.
