<p>
GNU GLOBAL is a source code tag system that works the same way
across diverse environments.
You can locate a specified function in the source files and move there easily.
It is useful for hacking a large project containing many subdirectories,
many <CODE>#ifdef</CODE> and many <CODE>main()</CODE> functions.
<p>
GNU GLOBAL is part of the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU project</a>,
and is <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free software</a>
(some times referred to as <a href="http://www.opensource.org">open source software</a>).
<p>
GNU GLOBAL has following features:

<ul>
<li> support C, C++, Yacc and Java.
<li> work the same way across diverse environments.
        Currently, support followings:
        <ul>
        <li> Generic shell command line
        <li> Bash shell
        <li> Vi clone editor (nvi, elvis, vim)
        <li> Emacs editor (emacs, mule, xemacs)
	<li> Less viewer
        <li> Web browser
		(See <a href=/tour/global/index.html>the example</a>
                 of GLOBAL itself.)
        </ul>
<li> find the locations of a specified object quickly.
<li> locate not only object definitions but also object references.
<li> allows duplicate objects.
<li> locate also path which includes specified pattern.
<li> treat a source tree containing subdirectories as a logical scope.
You can get the relative path of objects from anywhere within that scope.
<li> search not only in a source tree but also in library paths.
<li> understand POSIX 1003.2 regular expressions.
<li> support external search engine (grep and idutils).
<li> support external database as tag files (postgres).
<li> generate hypertext of source code.
<li> tag files are independent of machine architecture.
<li> plugged-in parser is available to treat new language.
<li> compact format is available to save disk space.
<li> support incremental updating of tag files.
<li> support customizing with global.conf.
<li> generate completion list for completing input method.
</ul>

If you have a plan to make a yet another editor with tag facility
then you can use GLOBAL as the tag system.
