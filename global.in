GNU GLOBAL is a source code tagging system that works the same way
across diverse environments, such as Emacs editor, Vi editor,
Less viewer, Bash shell, various web browsers, etc.
<p>
You can locate various objects, such as functions, macros, structs, classes,
in your source files and move there easily.
It is useful for hacking a large projects which contain many sub-directories,
many <code>#ifdef</code> and many <code>main()</code> functions.
It is similar to ctags or etags, but is different from them in the following two points:
<ul>
<li>independence of any editor</li>
<li>capability to treat definition and reference</li>
</ul>
It runs in UNIX (POSIX) compatible operating system, like GNU and BSD.
<p>
GNU GLOBAL is part of the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU project</a>,
and is <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free software</a>.
You can freely copy, modify and redistribute this program under
<a href=license.html>GNU GPL</a>.
<p>
GNU GLOBAL has the following features:

<ul>
<li> supports 6 languages by built-in parser. (definition and reference)<br />
C, C++, Yacc, Java, PHP4 and assembly.
<li> supports 25 languages by Pygments + Exuberant Ctags plug-in parser. (definition and reference)
<br />
Awk, Dos batch, COBOL, C, C++, C#, Erlang, Fortran, Java, JavaScript, Lisp, Lua, Pascal, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, Matlab, OCaml, Scheme, Tcl, TeX, Verilog, Vhdl and Vim.
<br />
To use the parser, please see the file 'plugin-factory/PLUGIN_HOWTO.pygments' in the package.

<li> works the same way across diverse environments like follows:
        <ul>
        <li> Shell command line
        <li> Bash shell
        <li> Vi editor (Nvi, Elvis, vim)
	<li> Less viewer
        <li> Emacs editor (Emacs, Mule, Xemacs)
        <li> Web browser
		(See <a href=http://www.tamacom.com/tour/kernel/linux/>UNIX kernel source tour!</a>.)
	<li> Doxygen documentation system
        </ul>
<li> finds locations of specified symbol quickly.
<li> locate not only definitions but also references.
<li> allows duplicate tags.
<li> locate paths which matches to the specified pattern.
<li> hierarchical searches by default.
<li> searches not only in a source project but also in library projects.
<li> generates completion list for completing input method.
<li> supports various output formats.
<li> allows customizing of the set of candidate files to be tagged.
<li> understands POSIX 1003.2 regular expression.
<li> supports idutils as an external search engine.
<li> tag files are independent of machine architecture.
<li> supports incremental updating of tag files.
<li> plug-in parser is available to treat new language.
<li> supports customizing with gtags.conf.
<li> generates a hypertext of source code.
<li> compact format to save disk space.
<li> supports client/server environment (TRAMP ready).
<li> ignores binary files, dot files and specified files.
<li> includes cscope-compatible program (gtags-cscope).
<li> includes grep-like command (-g command).
<li> deals with loop of symbolic links well.
</ul>

<p>
If you have a plan to make a yet another editor with tag facility,
you can use GLOBAL for it.
